# emotion-detection-through-speech
This project is about the detection of emotion from voice audio samples. This is a combination of audio signal processing and deep learning. The python package librosa is used for extraction of features from the audio samples and tensorflow was used for developing deep learning models based on the features.
The model has been trained on the Toronto emotional speech set and has achieved testing accuracy of 98%.
